# Quake 2 MD2 import add-on for Blender 2.8x

This add-on allows importing .md2 model files. This hasn't been
natively supported by [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for
a decade now. Please note that this add-on is still work
in progress.

## What can this importer (!) do so far?

- load an MD2 object to Blender
- attach a UV map linked in the .md2 file or a custom one
    - supported formats: .png, .jpg, .tga, .pcx
- load and run keyframe animations

## What is missing?

- proper error handling (some .md2 files store broken skin pathes or ones to files that don't exist)
- aligning the animation keyframes to the fps used for the different animations
- .pcx is no longer natively supported by Blender so a different package is used
that loads all skins as grayscale

## Installation

1. download the script and follow [this guide](https://github.com/rlguy/Blender-FLIP-Fluids/wiki/Addon-Installation-and-Uninstallation). When trying to activate the plugin, blender will show an error stating that the module PIL is missing. Proceed with Step 2.
2. [install Pillow (used for loading .pcx files)](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/122337). Replace `pip install scipy` with `pip install pillow`.
3. Check the plugin activation checkbox again.

## How to use

The script can be accessed via File > Import:

Checking "Load custom skin" allows loading a UV map different
from the one specified in the .md2 file. By entering a
"displayed name" the object and mesh name in the outliner
is specified.

Model keyframes are loaded with 9 empty frames in between
and displayed in the dope sheet.

In the UV editor you can see both the UV map and
the UV layout.

Using texture paint mode, this allows easily editing
and adding new UV maps. The current importer does not
support exporting a modified UV layout though.
